 Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a widely recognized algorithm used for measuring elastic dissimilarity in time series data. Its capability to handle non-linear time distortions makes it valuable in various data mining tasks, including anomaly detection, which seeks to identify unexpected patterns in datasets.
